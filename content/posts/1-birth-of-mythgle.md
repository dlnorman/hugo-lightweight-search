They said it couldn’t be done — a search engine that *understands* your hopes, fears, and mildly embarrassing late-night curiosities.

In 2003 BCE, two centaurs dropped out of Olympus Tech to “disrupt knowledge.” They called it **Mythgle** — “because Ask Hermes was taken.”

Their mission? *To organize all of mortal wisdom, divine gossip, and goat memes.*

Early beta testers loved it:
- “Finally, search results that are literally prophetic.” — Oracle of Delphi  
- “Found my lost hammer.” — Thor  
- “Knows when you’re lying.” — Pinocchio
