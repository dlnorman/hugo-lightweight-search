Sing, Muse, of searches vast and deep,  
Where mortals scroll but never sleep.  
Through cached domains and hidden lore,  
They seek the truth — or something more.  

Mythgle, bright beacon of the byte,  
Guide lost users through endless night.  
Deliver us from “Did you mean?”  
And bless each click — so unforeseen.
