Welcome back, seekers of flavor! 🍲

Today we’re making **Algorithmic Soup** — the dish that made Mythgle famous in culinary circles and confused in tech ones.

**Ingredients:**
- 2 terabytes of metadata  
- 1 dash of mystery  
- Infinite recursion to taste  

**Directions:**
1. Search “how to make soup.”  
2. Follow *the fourth result*, because the first three are sponsored.  
3. Serve warm with cookies (browser ones, preferably).
